# StackPot Mainnet Deployment Script
# ========================================
# This script deploys StackPot contracts to Stacks mainnet
# with DEMO MODE DISABLED and REAL StackingDAO integration
#
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  IMPORTANT PREREQUISITES:
# 1. Uncomment StackingDAO calls in stacking-adapter.clar
# 2. Set demo-mode = false in stacking-adapter.clar
# 3. Update Mainnet.toml with your production mnemonic
# 4. Test thoroughly on testnet first
# 5. Have sufficient STX for deployment fees
#
# Usage:
#   chmod +x scripts/deploy-mainnet.sh
#   ./scripts/deploy-mainnet.sh
# ========================================

set -e  # Exit on error
